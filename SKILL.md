# Caddy Docker Proxy — Local Dev Setup

## Why This Exists

When AI agents control your dev environment, you lose track of what's running where. An agent starts `npm run dev` on port 3000 in one terminal. You open a second project — another agent grabs port 3000, fails, falls back to 3001. A third project takes 3002. Now you have three apps on random ports across terminals you didn't open, and nobody knows which URL belongs to which project.

This gets worse with fullstack apps. Frontend, API, database — that's 3+ ports per project. Four projects? You're juggling 12 port assignments that change every time something restarts.

**The fix:** move everything into Docker and put a shared reverse proxy in front. Each project gets a stable, deterministic URL like `http://my-project.localhost`. No port conflicts. No guessing. Multiple projects run simultaneously because the proxy routes by hostname, not port number.

Uses [lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) for automatic routing via Docker labels. No Caddyfile needed.

## Architecture

```
Browser → http://myapp.localhost
         ↓ port 80
   caddy-docker-proxy (shared, machine-wide)
         ↓ reads Docker labels
   project containers on "caddy" network
```

One shared Caddy proxy runs in `~/caddy-proxy`. Each project joins the `caddy` external network and declares routing via labels. Modern browsers resolve `*.localhost` to 127.0.0.1 natively (RFC 6761) — no `/etc/hosts` editing.

## Prerequisites — Shared Proxy (one-time)

The shared proxy must be running before any project can use it. Create `~/caddy-proxy/docker-compose.yml` and start it:

```bash
docker network create caddy 2>/dev/null || true

mkdir -p ~/caddy-proxy
cat > ~/caddy-proxy/docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'
services:
  caddy:
    image: lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy:2.9-alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - CADDY_INGRESS_NETWORKS=caddy
    networks:
      - caddy
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - caddy_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  caddy:
    external: true

volumes:
  caddy_data: {}
EOF

cd ~/caddy-proxy && docker compose up -d
```

If the user already has this running, skip it.

## Per-Project Setup

Add three things to any `docker-compose.yml`:

### 1. Join the caddy network

```yaml
networks:
  caddy:
    external: true
```

### 2. Attach the service to it

```yaml
services:
  web:
    networks:
      - default
      - caddy
    expose:
      - "3000"
```

Use `expose` (not `ports`) — this makes the port visible to Caddy on the Docker network without binding it to your host. No port conflicts even if five projects all use port 3000 internally. Only add `ports` if you need to bypass the proxy and hit the container directly.

### 3. Add routing labels

**Simple (single service):**

```yaml
    labels:
      caddy: "http://${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 3000}}"
```

**With path-based routing (API + frontend):**

```yaml
    labels:
      caddy: "http://${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.@api.path: "/api/*"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_0: "@api backend:4001"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_1: "{{upstreams 3000}}"
```

**With WebSocket support:**

```yaml
    labels:
      caddy: "http://${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.@ws.path: "/ws"
      caddy.@api.path: "/api/*"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_0: "@ws backend:4001"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_1: "@api backend:4001"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_2: "{{upstreams 5174}}"
```

`{{upstreams PORT}}` resolves to the container running the labeled service. Named services like `backend:4001` reference other containers on the same Docker network.

## Label Reference

| Label | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `caddy` | Domain to match (e.g. `http://foo.localhost`) |
| `caddy.reverse_proxy` | Single upstream target |
| `caddy.reverse_proxy_N` | Ordered proxy rules (0 = highest priority) |
| `caddy.@name.path` | Named path matcher |
| `caddy.@name.header` | Named header matcher |

Numbered `reverse_proxy_N` directives are evaluated in order — put specific matchers (WebSocket, API) first, catch-all last.

## Common Patterns

### Monorepo (API + SPA)

Labels go on the frontend service. Backend is referenced by container name.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    networks: [default, caddy]
    expose: ["4000"]

  web:
    build: ./web
    networks: [default, caddy]
    expose: ["3000"]
    labels:
      caddy: "http://${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.@api.path: "/api/*"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_0: "@api api:4000"
      caddy.reverse_proxy_1: "{{upstreams 3000}}"

networks:
  caddy:
    external: true
```

### Multiple Independent Services

Each service gets its own subdomain by putting labels on each.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    labels:
      caddy: "http://app-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 3000}}"

  docs:
    labels:
      caddy: "http://docs-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}.localhost"
      caddy.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 8080}}"
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Target container not running or wrong port in label |
| No response at *.localhost | Shared proxy not running — `cd ~/caddy-proxy && docker compose up -d` |
| Container not found | Service not on `caddy` network — add `networks: [default, caddy]` |
| Wrong project routes | `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` defaults to directory name; set explicitly in `.env` if needed |
| Port conflict on :80 | Another process using port 80 — stop it or change the proxy port |

## Verification

```bash
# Check shared proxy is running
docker ps --filter name=caddy-proxy

# Check a project's caddy labels are detected
docker inspect <container> --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}' | jq 'with_entries(select(.key | startswith("caddy")))'

# Test the URL
curl -sf http://myproject.localhost/
```
